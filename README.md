# VanillaDataPackExamples
Processed, version controlled history of Minecraft's generated data and assets
Due to many removals, edits, lock, limitations of Misode's, Slicedlime's, Arcensoth's Mcmeta and SPGoding vanilla-datapack I've decided to make an easily available data of Minecraft latest version for anyone, mostly newby modders who want to learn creating their own data packs, look at the original code and start modifying. Enjoy.
mcmeta

# Repository structure
I've no idea. I'm just trying my best.

# Credits
