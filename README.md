# VanillaDataPackExamples
Processed, version controlled history of Minecraft's generated data and assets.
Due to many removals, edits, lock, limitations of Misode's, Slicedlime's, Arcensoth's Mcmeta and SPGoding vanilla-datapack I've decided to make an easily available data of Minecraft latest version for anyone, mostly newbie modders who want to learn creating their own data packs, look at the original code and start modifying mcmeta.

# Repository structure
I've no idea. I'm just trying my best.

# Credits
This project has taken inspiration from [Arcensoth/mcdata](https://github.com/Arcensoth/mcdata) and [SPGoding/vanilla-datapack](https://github.com/SPGoding/vanilla-datapack) and [Misode's McMeta](https://github.com/misode/mcmeta).
